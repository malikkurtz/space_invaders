# space_invaders

going to create a space invaders game
- User Input: spaceship object at the bottom of
the screen that will be controlled by the
left and right arrow keys, and will be able to fire projectiles (using space bar key) at alien objects who will disappear
if they are hit
- Game Over: the player loses the game if the aliens, who will be slowly moving toward the bottom of the screen
over time, collide with the player spaceship, or go past the bottom of the screen.
If this happens a "game over" screen will appear on screen and the player will be given the option to play again
using the "R" key without having to rerun the program
- Graphics/Images: the spaceship will  use sprite sheets to incorporate movement animation and we will be using png images for
the enemies, coins, and background planets
